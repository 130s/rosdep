release rosdep to pypi

create repo of standardized rosdeps -- use github

update rosdep seach path on /etc/rosdep/sources.list sources.list.d/*   build cache into /var/cache/rosdep

precedence system < /var/cache/rosdep <  ROS_PACKAGE_PATH < ROS_HOME
 * all are optional
 * possibly add more if necessary (e.g. cwd, sysarg override)

use apt syntax (update pulls from urls and populates cache)

status works for everything except source and homebrew, need verification on non debian platforms
